First day of a six-module [workshop series at the Toronto Public Library](https://tomesh.net/peer-to-peer-internet/), where participants experimented with peer-to-peer applications over a physical mesh network. The workshops used our [open-source syllabus](https://github.com/tomeshnet/p2p-internet-workshop) created by Toronto Mesh volunteers.
