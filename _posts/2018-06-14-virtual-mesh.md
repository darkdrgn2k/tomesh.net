Some Toronto Mesh members are connected through a virtual mesh network. This is a transitional phase where our mesh nodes are connected to one another using an internet connection instead of a physical line or radio. We are nonetheless able to test out distributed applications as if we were connected through a physical mesh.

This month we are meeting virtually on [#virtualmesh:tomesh.net](https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#virtualmesh:tomesh.net) to do some hands-on hacking. We will:

- Set up a [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) network
- Run streaming tests over [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)

Our nodes are connected over [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns). Although cjdns runs on multiple platforms, most people are [running it on a Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/tomeshnet/prototype-cjdns-pi). No matter how you want to join, we will be happy to help you get meshed up.
