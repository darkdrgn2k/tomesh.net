A group focused on learning p2p infrastructure management and creating the accompanying documentation.

A goal would be to make it easier for small groups/communities to run their own networks without needing extensive tech knowledge. Another would be to, as a group, manage a number of decentraland peers that are reliable and maintained for the long term.

All skill levels welcome and wanted.
