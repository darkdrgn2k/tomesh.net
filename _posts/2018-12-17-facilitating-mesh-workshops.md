This is a session to prepare future facilitators to organize a _Building the Peer-to-Peer Internet_ workshop, in part or in full, and variations of it. Participants should be familiar with social motivations and tensions around distributed systems, basic networking concepts, and are comfortable working in command line environments.

**Agenda**

1. Discuss course scope and learning outcomes
2. Discuss hardware requirements and share failure modes
3. Build course operating system and prepare mesh nodes together
4. Draw from existing content and explore facilitation possibilities
