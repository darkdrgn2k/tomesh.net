Based in Toronto, we are a grassroots and decentralized group of volunteers who started Toronto Mesh at [CivicTechTO](http://civictech.ca) in early 2016.  Through building community-owned infrastructure using off-the-shelf hardware and open-source technology, we are hoping to address barriers to internet access in our city. There are many ways for people to [get involved]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-involved).
